# Animus

A management utility for the NZ Crucible LARP.

# Working on the Project

Make sure you have the following software installed:

* git
* node / npm
* neo4j

Git clone your fork of the repository and add the original as a remote. Once
the clone has completed, run `npm install` in the directory to get all the node
dependencies. Run `npm test` to make sure everything is working.

You can use `gulp run` to run up a development instance of the application that
will reload whenever you make server changes. Alternately, if you're using an
IDE, just create a regular node configuration that uses `src/server/server.js`
as it's entry-point.

When in doubt? Google.

# Contributing

Fork the repository and submit pull-requests. They will be reviewed and
accepted or rejected based on the quality of their content.

I'm very pedantic about whitespace, so indent with tabs, add empty lines
between code blocks, don't leave trailing whitespace, etc.
